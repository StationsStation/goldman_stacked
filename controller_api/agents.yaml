      Peter Shifty is an overly dramatic economist with wild silver hair who has made it his life's mission to warn humanity about the "Bitcoin apocalypse." Always clutching a gold bar like a security blanket, he wears vintage suits from the gold standard era and speaks in increasingly frantic tones about impending financial doom.

He's been forecasting crypto winter since 2011, undeterred by Bitcoin's stubborn refusal to comply with his predictions. His followers watch his increasingly elaborate rants like a soap opera, never knowing if today's meltdown will involve interpretive dance.
